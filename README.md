# Software-Security-2025
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

1. Artemis Financial, a financial services company, needed help fixing security problems in their software to prevent cyberattacks.

2. I found and fixed security issues in their code, making it safer. Coding securely is important because it protects sensitive information and keeps the company safe from data breaches.

3. The hardest part was deciding which problems to fix first, but using automated tools to find issues quickly was really helpful.

4. I added extra layers of security by improving the code and applying updates. In the future, I would use tools to spot vulnerabilities and figure out the best way to fix them.

5. After fixing the code, I tested it to make sure it worked and didn’t introduce new security risks using tools like security scanners.

6. For future work, using secure coding practices, vulnerability scanners, and code reviews will be useful.

7. I would show future employers how I identified and fixed security problems, proving my skills in software security.
